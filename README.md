# web-visualizations-challenge
This is my solution to homework 14 for data boot camp

## Note
I went to Dom's class question and answer session. I used code from that session, credit and thanks to Dom!

## Overview
In this project, I used Plotly to visualize data on bellybutton biodiversity. I used HTML code to create the website and d3.json to fetch my data in a JSON file. I made several functions to create the bar graph, the bubble plot, the metadata display, the event handler for when the id changes, and to populate the dashboard with the visualizations. Here is the link to the website that I created: https://17sarahstoffel.github.io/web-visualizations-challenge/
